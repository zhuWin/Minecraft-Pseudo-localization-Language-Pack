# Pseudo-localization Language Pack For Minecraft (Pslo4MC)

**NOTE:This pack is currently in ALPHA.**


Inspired by some Microsoft Windows builds that use the qps-ploc pseudo language (like `[1iaT9][ Ẅĭпðøωś Þнôтŏ Ģάŀļєяÿ !!! !]`,known for Windows 8 Betas),I created Pseudo-localization Language Pack For Minecraft(PsLP4MC).<br>
This language pack added a language called `[4oSWE][Þŝęǘďö Ŀấňḡūǡǧe !]([QfIqk][₽șeǔđŏ !])` that imitates Microsoft's pseudo-localization language(`qps-ploc`).
Using this pack,you can use this language in Minecraft by selecting this language at the Lanauage Settings or simply by setting lang=qps_ploc in options.txt.
Using this language, you can verify Minecraft is localizable without actually localizing into a real language.
<br>
* Test your custom fonts in an international multilingual environment.
* Locate a translation string easily by locating the unique Hash ID.
* Match your pseudolocalizated Windows Builds???
* Just for fun???

# What is pseudo-localization?

With pseudolocalization, you can verify that your product is localizable without actually localizing into a real language. Many potential issues in localization can be discovered independently from actual translation. The pseudolocalization strategy can be applied in the earliest phases of development before translation begins. The strategy is sustained throughout the development cycle for continual testing and validation.

It simulates common effects of translation that commonly cause issues with a product. The transformation is readable enough that the product can still be used and tested without knowing a foreign language.

For more information about pseudolocalization,you can visit [https://learn.microsoft.com/globalization/methodology/pseudolocalization](https://learn.microsoft.com/globalization/methodology/pseudolocalization).
For Chinese users,there is also a readable [article]([https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv18226873) written Simplified Chinese.
